# Request page data for Next.js from the Notion API

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/next-js-request-page-data-for-next-js-from-the-notion-api)**

We will learn how to fetch page data from the Notion API, and build a static recipe website. We start with a page containing a list of recipes - each a link to its own recipe page - and use Next.js to create a pre-generated page listing our recipe titles.

In order to request data from our Notion API, we create a new integration and share the data from with page with it. We also learn about how to manage secret environment variables in our Next.js application, and how to conveniently pretty print the results from the `getStaticProps` function.

Lastly, we take the raw Notion data and transform it into a convenient array structure, that we can iterate over in our page component, and display in the browser.
